> **Normal updates to this mod are not meant to erase your vault.** Your per-character balances are stored in this mod’s encrypted vault data; we treat **preserving that data** as a requirement, and when the save format changes we intend to **migrate** old data forward instead of resetting it.
>
> **If a release ever cannot keep compatibility** (unexpected game update, unavoidable format break, etc.), maintainers follow **[SAVE_COMPATIBILITY.md](./SAVE_COMPATIBILITY.md)**: a **large warning at the top of this README**, the same message in **Thunderstore/Nexus** descriptions (via `docs/versions.json`), **changelog** backup steps, and an **in-game + BepInEx log** warning when needed. Until you see that warning, you should **not** need to delete saves or expect a wiped vault from a routine mod update.

**The Vault 3** is a Sun Haven BepInEx mod: per-character vault, encrypted saves, HUD, auto-deposit, and shop plus inventory integration (vault counts apply when the game checks or spends currency from your bag—shops, keys, and similar). Ship **`TheVault.dll`** and **`TheVault.Abstractions.dll`** in `BepInEx/plugins/TheVault`. Sources: plugin **`TheVault/TheVault.csproj`**, API shim **[`TheVault.Abstractions/`](../TheVault.Abstractions/)** (**`TheVault.Abstractions.csproj`**).

## Features

- Per-character encrypted vault (`VaultSaveSystem`, `VaultManager`)
- Auto-deposit, shop hooks, inventory hooks for vault-backed currency (e.g. keys), on-screen HUD
- Secret Gifts tracking in `SecretGifts.dat`
- **Custom** tab and runtime currency registration for other mods (`VaultIntegration` / `TheVault.Abstractions`)

## Usage

- **Main window:** IMGUI vault UI (**Ctrl+V** or **F8**). The HUD hides while the window is open.
- **F7:** Toggle HUD.
- **HUD position:** drag the **top accent strip** to move the bar; **`[HUD] PositionX`** / **`PositionY`** in `TheVault.cfg` persist placement. **`[HUD] Position`** is the anchor when those are `-1`; changing **Position** clears a custom drag placement.
- Select a row, enter a quantity, then **Withdraw** (vault → bag) or **Deposit** (bag → vault). Status text under the buttons reports success or errors (not only the BepInEx log).
- **`[HUD] Density`:** **Normal**, **Compact**, or **Minimal**. **`[HUD] CompactMode`** still narrows the bar when Density is **Normal**. The in-game **Settings** tab shows HUD density and the compact toggle.

## Full vault inspector

Enable **`[The Vault] FullVaultInspector = true`** in `BepInEx/config/HavenDevTools.cfg`, or in **Haven Dev Tools** (F11) → **Azrael's Mods** → **The Vault**. The vault **Settings** tab shows whether this mode is on (it is not stored in `TheVault.cfg`).

When enabled:

- Tabs list **every defined currency**, including **0** balance.
- A **Debug** tab shows a **text dump** of all vault stores (seasonal, community, keys, tickets, orbs, custom).
- The **HUD** lists **all** seasonal / key / special slots and **all** custom ids (including zeros).

## Custom currencies (other mods)

The vault UI includes a **Custom** tab for currencies registered at runtime. From another BepInEx plugin:

1. Add a dependency so your mod loads after The Vault: `[BepInDependency("com.azraelgodking.thevault")]`.
2. After the vault is ready (`TheVault.Api.VaultIntegration.IsVaultReady`), call `VaultIntegration.RegisterCustomCurrency(id, displayName, gameItemId, enableAutoDeposit)`.
   - `id`: short key, lowercase letters, digits, and underscore only (max 64). Do **not** include the `custom_` prefix; storage uses `custom_{id}`.
   - `gameItemId`: Sun Haven item id for withdraw and optional auto-deposit mapping; use `-1` for a balance with no inventory item.
   - `enableAutoDeposit`: only applies when `gameItemId > 0` and the player turns on the row toggle in the vault UI (same behavior as built-in currencies).

**Orphan balances:** If a mod registers a custom currency and is later removed, saved totals can remain under `CustomCurrencies` in the vault file. They still **load**; enable **full vault inspector** (Haven Dev Tools → The Vault) and open the **Debug** tab to see raw keys. Re-register the same short id if you want them back in the normal **Custom** tab with labels.

**Hooks for other mods:** `VaultManager` exposes `OnVaultLoaded` and `OnCurrencyChanged` (full currency id + old/new amounts). Subscribe via `Plugin.GetVaultManager()` after the vault exists.

**Thin API assembly:** reference **`TheVault.Abstractions.dll`** (same folder as `TheVault.dll`). At runtime use **`TheVault.Modding.VaultModApiBridge.Instance`** (`IVaultModApi`: `IsVaultReady`, `RegisterCustomCurrency`). This mirrors `VaultIntegration` without referencing the game or the main plugin assembly.

## Build

- `dotnet build TheVault/TheVault.csproj` → `TheVault.dll` and **`TheVault.Abstractions.dll`** copied next to each other under `BepInEx/plugins/TheVault` (see the csproj `CopyToPlugins` targets). **Distribute both** to players; dependent mods may reference only the abstractions assembly.
- Optional unit tests (no Unity): `dotnet test TheVault/Tests/TheVault.Tests.csproj -c Release`

## Version

**Released version is `3.0.5`** (BepInEx, Thunderstore, Nexus). Source of truth: **`TheVault.csproj`** / **`docs/versions.json`**.

**Maintainer note:** Same as the [repo root README](../../README.md): do not bump **any** mod’s published version unless the owner explicitly asks for a release.

## Changelog

### Unreleased
- **Changed:** Removed dead uGUI panel source (`UI/VaultUguiPanel.cs`) and unused legacy-IMGUI toggle plumbing in `VaultUI`; the active IMGUI path remains unchanged.
- **Changed:** Restored HUD and window scale upper bound to `3.0` (from `2.5`) to avoid silently clamping existing larger user settings.
- **Fixed:** Configs now appear in BepInEx Configuration Manager. The mod binds entries to a custom `ConfigFile` (`thevault.cfg`) rather than the default per-GUID file, and Configuration Manager only scans each plugin's inherited `BaseUnityPlugin.Config` property — so it never saw our entries. `ConfigFileHelper.ReplacePluginConfig` now rewires that inherited property to the custom file via reflection right after Awake, so the live config UI picks up every `Config.Bind(...)` call without changing the config file name or path.
- **Fixed:** `VaultUI` no longer calls `InitializeStyles()` from `Awake` / `OnEnable` / `SetScale` (those touch `GUI.skin` outside `OnGUI` and could throw `ArgumentException`, preventing the plugin from loading). Styles are built lazily on the first `OnGUI` when the window is shown, with a `_stylesDirty` flag when scale changes.
- Added a `VaultModApiBridge.OnVaultLoaded` bridge event notification so soft-dependent mods can register integrations after vault data is actually loaded.

### 3.0.4

- **HUD:** Draggable via the top accent strip; **`[HUD] PositionX`** / **`PositionY`** in `thevault.cfg` persist placement.

### 3.0.3

- **Compatibility:** Mod hotkeys defer while typing in chat, the console, or UI text fields when **CheatEnabler** is present (shared `TextInputFocusGuard`).

### 3.0.2

- **Auto-deposit** only runs when items are added to the **player’s main bag** (`PlayerInventory` / `Inventory`), not chests or other inventories. Prevents vault + bag duplication when closing UI while holding an item, and the same class of bug for museum rewards and ground pickups that retried on the player bag.
- **RemoveItem** integration: the prefix now reads **raw** bag counts (skips the vault `GetAmount` postfix). Previously the prefix treated vault + bag as “in bag,” so shops, keys, and gates never deducted vault currency when the bag was empty.
- **RemoveItem / withdraw** helpers prefer **`PlayerInventory`** over `Inventory` so removals match the bag the UI uses.
- **Shop** `BuyItem`: registers **postfixes** so items registered via `ShopPatches.RegisterVaultPurchase` actually **deduct** vault currency after purchase (prefix-only allowed the sale but never charged).
- **HasEnough** postfix only augments **player** inventories so chests are not treated as having your vault balance.
- Removed unused **`DoorPatches.cs`** (never wired to Harmony; gates and keys use the **`Inventory`** patches in **`ItemPatches`**).

### 3.0.0

**The Vault 3** updates the mod for current Sun Haven builds: one plugin assembly, tighter game integration (typed `Wish.*` / game types where it matters), HUD and vault UI polish, safer inventory/vault bookkeeping, pickup toasts that show **`NN× ItemName`**, and a **Custom** tab plus **`TheVault.Abstractions`** for other mods. Full vault inspection is controlled from **Haven Dev Tools**, not `thevault.cfg`.

Highlights:

- **Vault UI & HUD:** IMGUI vault window; HUD density presets, improved layout and scaling, less per-frame churn; width-capped, multi-row HUD with stable currency order.
- **Integration:** Harmony patches aligned with real game types (`GameSave`, `Shop`, `Inventory`, `Player`, etc.); character/vault identity from typed save data; shop and inventory paths use **`Wish.*`** APIs on the fast path where applicable.
- **Reliability:** `RemoveItem` vault deduction only when a valid pre-remove count is known; suppressed during auto-deposit/sweep paths; cached reflection for inventory removal to cut noise and cost.
- **Modding:** `VaultIntegration.RegisterCustomCurrency`, `OnVaultLoaded` / `OnCurrencyChanged`, and **`TheVault.Abstractions.dll`** for dependents.
- **Tooling & releases:** Thunderstore package includes icon, readme, both DLLs; CI Nexus upload uses **`Nexus-Mods/upload-action@v1.0.0-beta.3`** (API `data` envelope). **`Version` / `AssemblyVersion`** in **`TheVault.csproj`** and **`TheVault.Abstractions.csproj`** match **`docs/versions.json`**.
- **Maintenance:** `VaultDataSanitizer` after load; shared `VaultCurrencyIds`; **NUnit** tests under `Tests/`.
- **Save compatibility policy:** **[SAVE_COMPATIBILITY.md](./SAVE_COMPATIBILITY.md)** documents the maintainer checklist (README callout, `docs/versions.json` `vault_save_breaking` / `vault_breaking_banner`, Thunderstore readme, changelog backup steps, **`VaultSaveCompatibility.ThisReleaseMayBreakVaultSaves`**). Release CI prepends the banner to store descriptions and syncs **`manifest.json`** `description`.

**Project layout:** Everything lives under [`TheVault/`](./) (`Plugin.cs`, `Patches/`, `Vault/`, `UI/`). Output is **`TheVault.dll`** with GUID `com.azraelgodking.thevault`, plus **`TheVault.Abstractions.dll`**.

**Build note:** Compile-time reference to `Sirenix.Serialization.dll` from `Sun Haven_Data/Managed` (notification-related UI bases). Runtime needs BepInEx and the game as usual.
