# The Vault - Sun Haven Mod

A quality-of-life mod that automatically manages your seasonal tokens, community tokens, and keys.

## What It Does

- **Auto-Deposit**: Tokens and keys go directly to your vault when picked up
- **Seamless Spending**: Shops and locked doors use vault currencies automatically - no withdrawing needed
- **Per-Character Storage**: Each character has their own separate vault
- **Auto-Save**: Vault saves every 5 minutes and when the game saves

## Supported Currencies

**Seasonal Tokens**: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter
**Keys**: Copper, Iron, Adamant, Mithril, Sunite, Glorite, King's Lost Mine
**Special**: Community Token, Doubloon, Black Bottle Cap, Red Carnival Ticket, Candy Corn Pieces, Mana Shard

## Controls

- `Ctrl+V` - Open/close vault UI
- `F8` - Alternative open/close (Steam Deck friendly, no modifier needed)
- `F7` - Toggle HUD display on/off
- `Escape` - Close vault UI
- `-1/-5/-10 buttons` - Quick withdraw to inventory
- `ON/--` toggle - Enable/disable auto-deposit per currency

## Installation

1. Install BepInEx 5.x for Unity games
2. Download TheVault.dll from Nexus Mods
3. Place in `BepInEx/plugins/TheVault/`
4. Launch Sun Haven

## Configuration

Edit `BepInEx/config/com.azraelgodking.thevault.cfg`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| ToggleKey | V | Key to open vault |
| RequireCtrlModifier | true | Require Ctrl when pressing toggle |
| AltToggleKey | F8 | Alternative key (no modifier, Steam Deck friendly) |
| EnableHUD | true | Show persistent HUD bar with vault totals |
| HUD Position | TopLeft | HUD position (TopLeft, TopCenter, TopRight, BottomLeft, BottomCenter, BottomRight) |
| HUD ToggleKey | F7 | Key to toggle HUD visibility |
| EnableAutoSave | true | Auto-save vault data |
| AutoSaveInterval | 300 | Save interval in seconds |

## How It Works

1. When you pick up a supported item, it enters your inventory briefly then moves to the vault
2. Shops check your vault balance when you try to buy with tokens/keys
3. Locked doors/chests check your vault for required keys
4. Vault deducts automatically on purchase/unlock
